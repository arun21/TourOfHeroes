# TourOfHeroes

The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Angular.
In this tutorial you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

# Agenda

Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
Format data with pipes.
Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
